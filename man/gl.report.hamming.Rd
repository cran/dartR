\title{Calculates the pairwise Hamming distance between DArT trimmed DNA sequences}
\usage{
gl.report.hamming(
  x,
  rs = 5,
  boxplot = "adjusted",
  range = 1.5,
  threshold = 3,
  taglength = 69,
  probar = FALSE,

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{-- name of the genlight object containing the SNP data [required]}

\item{rs}{-- number of bases in the restriction enzyme recognition sequence [default 5]}

\item{boxplot}{-- if 'standard', plots a standard box and whisker plot; 
if 'adjusted', plots a boxplot adjusted for skewed distributions [default 'adjusted']}

\item{range}{-- specifies the range for delimiting outliers [default = 1.5 interquartile ranges]}

\item{threshold}{minimum acceptable base pair difference for display on the whisker plot and histogram [default 3 bp]}

\item{taglength}{-- typical length of the sequence tags [default 69]}

\item{probar}{-- if TRUE, then a progress bar is desplayed on long loops [default TRUE]}

\item{verbose}{-- verbosity: 0, silent or fatal errors; 1, begin and end; 2, progress log ; 3, progress and results summary; 5, full report [default 2 or as specified using gl.set.verbosity]}

\description{
Hamming distance is calculated as the number of base differences between two 
sequences which can be expressed as a count or a proportion. Typically, it is
calculated between two sequences of equal length. In the context of DArT
trimmed sequences, which differ in length but which are anchored to the left
by the restriction enzyme recognition sequence, it is sensible to compare the
two trimmed sequences starting from immediately after the common recognition
sequence and terminating at the last base of the shorter sequence.
}
\details{
Hamming distance can be computed by exploiting the fact that the dot product 
of two binary vectors x and (1-y) counts the corresponding elements that are 
different between x and y. This approach can also be used for vectors that 
contain more than two possible values at each position (e.g. A, C, T or G).

If a pair of DNA sequences are of differing length, the longer is truncated.

The algorithm is that of Johann de Jong 
\url{https://johanndejong.wordpress.com/2015/10/02/faster-hamming-distance-in-r-2/}
as implimented in utils.hamming.r

A histogram and whiskerplot can be requested. Both display a user specified value
for the minumum acceptable Hamming distance.
