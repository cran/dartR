\item{t.hom}{-- tolerance, that is t.hom=0.05 means that 5\% of the homogametic sex can be heterozygous and still be regarded as consistent with a sex specific marker [default 0]}

\item{t.pres}{-- tolerance, that is t.pres=0.05 means that a silicodart marker can be present in either of the sexes and still be regarded as a sex-linked marker. [default 0]}

\item{plot}{-- creates a plot that shows the heterozygosity of males and females at each loci for SNP data or percentage of present/absent in the case of silicodart data.

two list of sex specific loci, for XX/XY and ZZ/ZW systems.

\description{
Alleles unique to the Y or W chromosome and monomorphic on the X chromosomes will appear in the SNP dataset as 
genotypes that are heterozygotic in all individuals of the heterogametic sex and homozygous in all individuals 
of the homogametic sex.
}
\details{
This script will identify loci with alleles that behave in this way, as putative sex specific SNP markers.

Sex of the individuals for which sex is known with certainty can be provided via a factor (equal to the length of the number of individuals) or to be held in the variable \code{x@other$ind.metrics$sex}.
Coding is: M for male, F for female, U or NA for unknown/missing. The script abbreviates the entries here to the first character. So coding of "Female" and "Male" works as well. Character are also converted to upper cases.
