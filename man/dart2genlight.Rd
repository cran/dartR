\title{Convert DarT to genlight}
\usage{
dart2genlight(dart, covfilename = NULL, probar = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dart}{a dart object created via read.dart}

\item{covfilename}{optional file in csv format with covariates for each individual (see details for explanation)}

\item{probar}{show progress bar}
}
\value{
a genlight object is returned. Including all available slots are filled. loc.names, ind.names, pop, lat, lon (if provided via the covariate file)
}
\description{
converts a dart file (read via \code{read.dart}) into an genlight object \code{\link{adegenet}}. Internal function called by gl.read.dart
}
\details{
the covariate file needs to have very specific headings. First an heading called id. Here the ids have to match the ids in the dart object \code{colnames(dart[[4]])}. The following column headings are optional. pop: specifies the population membership of each individual. lat and lon specify spatial coordinates (perferable in decimal degrees WGS1984 format). Additional columns with individual covariates can be imported (e.g. age, gender).
