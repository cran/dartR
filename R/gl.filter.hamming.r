#' Filters loci in a genlight object based on pairwise Hamming distance between sequence tags
#'
#' Hamming distance is calculated as the number of base differences between two 
#' sequences which can be expressed as a count or a proportion. Typically, it is
#' calculated between two sequences of equal length. In the context of DArT
#' trimmed sequences, which differ in length but which are anchored to the left
#' by the restriction enzyme recognition sequence, it is sensible to compare the
#' two trimmed sequences starting from immediately after the common recognition
#' sequence and terminating at the last base of the shorter sequence. 
#'
#' Hamming distance can be computed 
#' by exploiting the fact that the dot product of two binary vectors x and (1-y)
#' counts the corresponding elements that are different between x and y.
#' This approach can also be used for vectors that contain more than two possible 
#' values at each position (e.g. A, C, T or G).
#'
#' If a pair of DNA sequences are of differing length, the longer is truncated.
#'
#' The algorithm is that of Johann de Jong

#' as implimented in utils.hamming.r
#' 
#' Only one of two loci are retained if their Hamming distance is less that a specified
#' percentage. 5 base differences out of 100 bases is a 20% Hamming distance.
