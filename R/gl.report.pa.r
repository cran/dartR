#' Report number of private alleles possessed by an individual of unknown provenance
#'
#' This script calculates the number of private alleles possessed by a focal individual of unknown
#' provenance when compared to a series of target populations.
#'
#' @param gl -- name of the input genlight object [required]
#' @param id -- identity label of the focal individual whose provenance is unknown [required]
#' @param nmin -- minimum sample size for a target population to be included in the analysis [default 10]
#' @param t -- populations to retain in the output genlight object; those for which the focal individual has less than or equal to t loci with private alleles [default 0]
#' @return A genlight object containing the focal individual (assigned to population "unknown") and 
#' populations for which the focal individual is not distinctive (number of loci with private alleles less than or equal to thresold t.
