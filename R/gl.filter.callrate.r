#' Filter loci or specimens in a genlight \{adegenet\} object based on call rate
#'
#' SNP datasets generated by DArT have missing values primarily arising from failure to call a SNP because of a mutation
#' at one or both of the the restriction enzyme recognition sites. This script filters out loci (or specimens) for which the call rate is
#' lower than a specified value. The script will also filter out loci (or specimens) in SilicoDArT (presence/absence) datasets where the call rate
#' is lower than the specified value. In this case, the data are missing owing to low coverage.
#' 
#' Because this filter operates on call rate, and previously applied functions may not have recalculated locus metrics, this function recalculates Call Rate before filtering.
#' Recalculaton after filtering remains optional, with no recalculation as the default.
#' 
#' Note that when filtering individuals on call rate, the initial call rate is calculated and compared against the threshold. After filtering, if mono.rm=TRUE, the removal of
#' monomorphic loci will alter the call rates. Some individuals with a call rate initially greater than the nominated threshold, and so retained, may come to have a call rate
#' lower than the threshold. If this is a problem, repeated iterations of this function will resolve the issue.
#' 
#' @param  x name of the genlight object containing the SNP data, or the genind object containing the SilocoDArT data [required]
#' @param method -- "loc" to specify that loci are to be filtered, "ind" to specify that specimens are to be filtered [default "loc"]
#' @param threshold -- threshold value below which loci will be removed [default 0.95]
#' @param plot specify if a histogram of call rate is to be produced [default FALSE]
#' @param mono.rm -- Remove monomorphic loci [default TRUE]
#' @param recalc -- Recalculate the locus metadata statistics if any individuals are deleted in the filtering [default FALSE]
#' @param v -- verbosity: 0, silent or fatal errors; 1, begin and end; 2, progress log ; 3, progress and results summary; 5, full report [default 2]
#' @return The reduced genlight or genind object, plus a summary
